# ATR-SB AI-Algo
* ATR-SB AI-Algo is an indicator which works based on calculating the "trend line" from each candle's close price (EMA1) and ATR (average true range). This algorithm starts displaying sell/buy signals based on complex mathematical formulas.

* You can check this indicator out on [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/dAfm1Hmv/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSD)
