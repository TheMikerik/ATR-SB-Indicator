# ATR-SB Indicator
ATR-Sell/Buy Indicator which works based on calculating the "trend line" from each candle's close price, ATR (average true range) and complex formula connected to it. Sell/Buy signal starts to occur when the trend line crosses with EMA with a length of 1 (connecting closes of each candle). There is also a possibility to customize the risk that is being taken. If you want to do so, please edit that directly in the indicator settings in the Trading View. Do not change the default value of it in the code. The higher the number of RISK you set, the more intense the signals become.
